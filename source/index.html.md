# Introduction

> API Endpoint

```shell
https://api.mementopayments.com
```

The Memento Payments API is designed around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).
Authentication is based on a pair of authentication and session tokens.
[JSON](http://www.json.org/) is returned by all API responses, including errors.

If you are using the Memento Payments Cloud you need to either provide your project's ID in the header of each request or send requests to your custom host name (CNAME).

All examples in this reference are based on the Memento Payments Cloud endpoint.

# Authentication

To successfully connect to the platform the user needs an authentication token and a session token. The authentication token is used to create a new session token (initially and when the current one expires) and the session token is used for all operations.

All requests to the API need to be accompanied by an Authorization header:

`Authorization: Bearer wxKj3JV6ET1dXVou77675tMqC...`

## Get authentication token

> Example Request

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.mementopayments.com/v1/tokens" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d $'{
  "identity": {
      "type": "username",
      "value": "jondough"
  },
  "authenticator": "password",
  "secret": "123456",
  "device": {
      "uuid": "582a5abb-1335-4794-4855-11e067b8c55e",
      "make": "iPhone",
      "model": "iPhone6,2",
      "os_name": "iOS",
      "os_version": "8.0",
      "screen_width": 480,
      "screen_height": 640,
      "sdk_version": "17"
  }
}'
```

> Example Response

```shell
{
    "uuid": "8d3f94b0-87d0-497f-810c-9b150d42ed05",
    "status_id": 1, // pending
    "token": "wxKj3JV6ET1dXVou77675tMqC..."
}
```

Post identity type + value (e.g. phone number), type of authentication (e.g. "sms") and device. The response will include a UUID and status for lookup.

### HTTP Request
